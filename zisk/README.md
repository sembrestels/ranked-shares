# zisk: the whole PB-EAR tally proven in a ZisK guest

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-sealed-ballots-zisk-design.md`.

| Crate | What |
|---|---|
| `crates/pbear` | PB-EAR over `u64`, tested against `reference/pbear.py` |
| `crates/sealed` | witness types, secp256k1 ECDH + keccak pad, voter chain, `inputsHash`, output hash, `tally::run` |
| `guest` | the ZisK program: read, run, commit 32 bytes |

## Host

    cargo test                        # pbear + sealed, needs python3 for the differential test
    cargo run -p sealed --bin fixture-input -- ../reference/vectors/zisk/fixture_main.json main.bin

## Guest

    ~/.zisk/bin/cargo-zisk build --release -p tally-guest
    scripts/emu-check.sh main         # emulator run, compares the committed bytes with the fixture
    cargo test -p sealed --test fixtures -- --ignored   # the same, from cargo

The ELF lands in `target/elf/riscv64ima-zisk-zkvm-elf/release/tally-guest`.

ZisK v1.2.0-alpha. On this machine every ZisK process needs
`HWLOC_COMPONENTS=-gl` and, for the PLONK wrap, `GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.rtld.execstack=2`.
