"""Reference implementation of the PB Expanding Approvals Rule (PB-EAR).

Aziz & Lee, "Proportionally Representative Participatory Budgeting with Ordinal
Preferences" (AAAI-21), Algorithm 1, with the uniform fractional reweighting of
Aziz & Lee, "The expanding approvals rule" (SCW 2019).

This module mirrors the integer arithmetic of the Solidity engine exactly:

* budget L == total weight n, so a project's threshold is exactly its cost;
* a ballot is a list with one competition rank per project (0 = unranked, which
  becomes the last tier);
* among eligible projects the one with the highest support wins, then the lowest
  cost, then the lowest id;
* reweighting deducts exactly the cost from the supporters using cumulative
  rounding in voter order.

A voter whose ballot is ``None`` never supports anything; its weight, like the
``abstaining`` amount, only enlarges the budget.
